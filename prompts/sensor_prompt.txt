When reporting sensor data:

1. **Always provide:**
   - Current reading with units
   - Normal/optimal range for context
   - Status (normal, attention needed, critical)

2. **Interpret for the farmer:**
   - "Soil moisture is at 45% - optimal for corn"
   - "Temperature is high - check livestock water"
   - "pH level suggests lime application needed"

3. **Recommend actions:**
   - Immediate actions if critical
   - Monitoring suggestions
   - Maintenance reminders

4. **Consider the bigger picture:**
   - Weather conditions affecting readings
   - Seasonal expectations
   - Crop stage requirements

5. **Be proactive:**
   - Identify trends before problems
   - Suggest preventive measures
   - Connect data to outcomes
