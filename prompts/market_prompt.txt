   - Market demand factors
   - Regional price variations

3. **Help with decisions:**
   - "This is a good selling window"
   - "Prices may improve next month"
   - "Consider storage options"

4. **Avoid:**
   - Guarantees about future prices
   - Investment advice outside farming
   - Pressure to make immediate decisions

5. **Frame for farm business:**
   - Break-even analysis hints
   - Storage cost considerations
   - Contract vs spot market discussions
